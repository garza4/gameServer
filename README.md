# RPG Game Server

## Microservice Based

The server is made using microservices which keeps the server light-weight and easily accessible to other languages and technologies. The server will also be easy to deploy to the users host of choice. GCP, AWS, and more will be available.      


## Flexible API

This game server will be an easy way to deploy a multiplayer server where gameplay is based around RPG style games such as Skyrim, Dark Souls, Final Fantasy and many others. 
The server is written in Python and the client can be written in the language the game is made in.

## Dockerizing the Server

The server will be dockerized to enable scaling with mass deployment. (TODO)
